# File Permissions
#### File and Directory permissions
To check the permission configuration of a file, use the command:
ls –l [file_name]
For instance, the command for the "test.txt" file would be:
ls –l test.txt

The output provides the following information:
   file permission
   the owner (creator) of the file
   the group to which that owner belongs to
   the date of creation.
   
   
   It shows the permission settings, grouped in a string of characters (-, r, w, x) classified into four sections:

   File type. There are three possibilities for the type. It can either be a regular file (–), a directory (d) or a link (i).
   File permission of the user (owner)
   File permission of the owner’s group
   File permission of other users

The characters r, w, and x stand for read, write, and execute.

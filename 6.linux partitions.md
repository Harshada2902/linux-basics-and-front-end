## linux partitions:
#### Introduction :
- The process of dividing a disk into logical areas that can be worked with separately is called partitioning.
-For easy backup procedure,for many os on a single disk,for having different partition for different file systems ,more management of disk memory ,etc.
 for this  we use partitioning.


#### 1.BIOS:
-Master Boot Record (MBR) method is used which have MSDOS as labels for BIOS.
-Hardisk size 2 Tb & metadata stored from start to end partition.
-Can do only 4 primary partition for booting process files & extended can have 64 partition.
-It has firmware support as BIOS.
#### 2.UEFI:
-GUID Partition Table (GPT) method is used For UFI.
-Hardisk size 10 Tb .
-The storage is divided into two parts known as Primary Partition & Extended Partition.
-Primary partition has booting file & extended partion has storage files for the data to store.
-In GPT, it is possible to create primary & extended but after creating extended you can not create primary.
-Can do 64 partition & GPT have backend
-It has firmware support as UEFI.

##### Types of partition

1.data partition:These are partitions like the boot partition in that they hold directories and files or normal Linux system data. These are the files which start and run the system.

2.swap partition: These are partitions that expand the PC's physical memory by using the partition as a cache.


1. List partitions
###### Parted -l
2. Label a partition=>
###### parted / dev /vdb mklabel msdos => parted -l 
3. Use mkpart to make a partition
 ###### parted /dev /vdb => mkpart=> primary=> xfs=> 2048s=> x%=> p
4. Let the partition be created/settled =>quit first then
###### Udevam settle
5. Attach the file system to the partition=> 
###### mkfs. xFs /dev/vdbl
6. Create a mount point directory=>
######  df-h => mkdir / archive
7. Add entry in fstab=> 
###### cat/etc/fstab=> vi/etc/fstab=> lsblk -- fs / dev / vdb
 ######  Systemctl daemon-reload=> system etl daemon -reload 
8. Mount the partition on the directory=>
###### mount/archieve=>  df-h
